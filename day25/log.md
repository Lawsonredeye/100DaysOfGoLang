# ORMS && Databases

So far so good, we've been learning about how to write simple queries on MySQL, learning about how to handle http routers for a custom web server and how to create a JSON file but we've not yet touched on DataBases yet.

So, i would be looking at GORM as it is one of the Golang ORMs for connecting to database and i believe would be beginner friendly.

# How to install
To install the gorm and its driver use the following command
0. create a folder and cd into the folder
1. run `go get -u gorm.io/gorm` to install the orm
2. then run `go get -u gorm.io/driver/sqlite` to install the driver
