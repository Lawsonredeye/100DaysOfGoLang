# More on Basic Authentication on net/http

I continued my journey on learning how to create a basic simple authenticated web server using golang net/http library and also practiced using the JetBrain resource on learning the different types of ways to authenticate your `API` and `web servers`.

Authentication is a major thing to consider and lack of authentication means one can use your application how they like.

You can check out the resources below to learn what i learned for today. Cheers!
