# Building an E-commerce Backend API

So, to take my final bow with my 100 days challenge, i am planning on building an ecommerce backend API with simple features like auth, adding of products, creating categories and also allow testing by users.

This would be done using Gin and GORM + MySQL driver for now and then for future iterations i plan on going larger to what the e-commerce would have.

If this project is completed before the 100th day then i'll have to dive into another project(probably a CLI application using cobra, haha).

Without futherado, Let Ship!
