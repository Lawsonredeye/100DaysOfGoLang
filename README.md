# 100 Days Of GoLang

This is my documentation of my 100 days of GoLang and my aim is to build an Ecommerce backend that would later be integrated with a frontend with language like HTMX or using any JS framework (React).

This would be quite interesting as i would be using the roadmap from [roadmap.sh/golang](https://roadmap.sh/golang).

Tasks/mini projects would be added upon each week to further solidify my memory.

## Documentation
Documentation would be stored inside a *logs.md* be sure to check them to see added info about each day.

Let's rock and roll, Gophers.
