# Building Microservices

## What is a Microservice

Microservices are an architectural style where an application is composed of small, independent services.
Microservices can be confused with APIs but infact, API defines how software components interact with each other, while Microservices exposes API for other services to interact with it.

## Benefits of Microservices
- Scalable
- Resilent as a failure occurence would affect the other services running
- Each part can be deployed on their own
- Is Not dependent on a single language or database application

### Downsides
- Too many moving parts to keep track of.
- version management and network latency could be an issue.
- managing data transactions could be difficult to manage.
