# Diving into the world of studying codes

Today i opened a golang repo to try to understand the logic and also to learn how to read other developer's code.

This is a great way to enhance and grow as a reviewer as most of the time, we might review others code instead of writing them ourselves.

What's next:

I plan on working on another project or picking up with learning CSS flexbox using the [FlexBox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) resource

Cheers.
