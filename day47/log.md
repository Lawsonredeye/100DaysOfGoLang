# Huffman tree

Today, i learned about the huffman compression which uses the huffman tree (similar to binary tree) for finding the frequencies of a given character and then compress it without the file losing all of its content.

The Huffman technique proved to be really amazing when it comes to compressing text (as this was the basics of my learning).

I also got to understand the working principle of how the Huffman algorithm works but impelementing it via code is something that its still hanging.

Do you know about the John Huffman algorithm? Connect and share it with me.
